###### Red teaming is _not_ penetration testing but penetration testing <span style="font-style: italic;">is red teaming</span>.

Information Security does not own red teaming. Red Teaming has been around for centuries and has been used throughout time for various purposes, assuredly most of these uses weren&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic;">cyber. </span>At its core, red teaming is applying a critical mindset to a process, plan or anything else you want to put there. With that in mind, penetration testing <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>red teaming, just not what you might consider red teaming applied to information security.

Red Teaming adapted for the Information Security profession is a niche in the InfoSec career field whereas Penetration Testing is a much more common profession. Some organizations use these terms interchangeably though which causes some confusion, especially to those just getting in.

###### So what <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> the difference?

  * Penetration Testing typically has the goal: Find all the vulnerabilities in this subnet, web app, host, network, <Insertwhateveryouwant>.
  * Red Teaming has the goal: Emulate an adversary with as much realism as possible.
  * Penetration Testing usually has a narrow scope; set of IP&#8217;s etc.
  * Red Teaming usually has a massive scope; phishing, entire external perimeter, physical etc.
  * I see penetration testing as an audit function, validating controls, testing for common vulnerabilities, etc.
  * I see red teaming as a holistic organization security meter; testing the blue team, user security awareness as well as determining that path of least resistance to total organization compromise.

A penetration test report should get shorter and shorter every time the pentesters are brought back, finding less and less vulnerabilities. On the other hand, a red team report should get longer and longer, having to use more and more footholds and weaknesses to execute on the goals of the operation.

_For those looking for jobs in one or the other, make sure you clarify in the job interview what the role is, a job could be listed as a red team role but consist of PCI _pentests_._
